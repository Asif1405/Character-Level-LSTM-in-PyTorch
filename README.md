# Character-Level-LSTM-in-PyTorch

### Overview:
In this project, I constructed a character-level LSTM with PyTorch. The network trains character by character on some text, then generate new text character by character. I trained on Anna Karenina. This model is able to generate new text based on the text from the book!
This network is based off of Andrej Karpathy's post on RNNs and implementation in Torch.

### Requirements:
Python 3.x
